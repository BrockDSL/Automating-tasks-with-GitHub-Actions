In this workshop, attendees will learn about the Actions aspect of GitHub which allows you to write workflows that can spin up processing environments, run commands and special functions called “Actions” and then close those environments automatically.

An understanding of using GitHub and basic experience with shell commands is recommended to get the most out of this workshop.
